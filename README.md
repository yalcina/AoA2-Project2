## Project-2 (Analysis of Algorithms-2, ITU)

Implementation of [*Karatsuba* Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm), a divide-and-conquer based multiplication operation. Coded in C++. *Karatsuba* method reduces the complexity of multiplication from **O(n<sup>2</sup>)** to **O(n<sup>log<sub>2</sub>3</sup>)** â‰ˆ **O(n<sup>1.58</sup>)**. However, due to the complex design of the program, *Karatsuba*, at least in this project, runs slower than the regular multiplication.
